# Functions, Code Blocks, and While loops 

# # FUNCTIONS
# # start with 'def' key word then 'name' and '()' end with ':'
# def prac_function():
#     print('Hello')
#     print('Bye')

# # to trigger the function you have to call it
# prac_function()


# WHILE LOOP
# 'while' 'condition': 'effect'
# be careful to give an ending otherwise you will get an infinite loop
